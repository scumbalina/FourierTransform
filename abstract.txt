Fourier Transforms with Wave Functions

Lauren Farmer, Dakota King, Jonah Shoemaker

The purpose of this study was to find the most efficient method of using Python to compute momentum-space Fourier transforms of one-dimensional position-space wave functions. Three methods were used: calculating the transforms by hand as a control, using the FFT function in Numpy, and building an algorithm to find the transforms. The algorithm was built with a for loop, which calculated the FT integral with different discrete wave-number values in each iteration using a Riemann sum technique. While the home-made algorithm was less accurate than the FFT function, it was designed to be easier to implement by the user for quantum transform applications. In addition, the self-designed algorithm was less robust at evaluating complex-valued wave functions, but more versatile at handling real-valued sinusoidal functions with no additional modifications required. Future goals include expanding the algorithm into multiple dimensions and incorporating numerical evaluations of complicated potentials to implement an all-inclusive user-friendly package for finding both position- and momentum-space functions of any potential.
